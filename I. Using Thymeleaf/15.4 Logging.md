Thymeleaf pays quite a lot of attention to logging, and always tries to offer the maximum amount of useful information through its logging interface.

The logging library used is `slf4j`, which in fact acts as a bridge to whichever logging implementation we might want to use in our application (for example, `log4j`).

Thymeleaf classes will log `TRACE`, `DEBUG` and `INFO`-level information, depending on the level of detail we desire, and besides general logging it will use three special loggers associated with the TemplateEngine class which we can configure separately for different purposes:

- `org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine.CONFIG` will output detailed configuration of the library during initialization.
- `org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine.TIMER` will output information about the amount of time taken to process each template (useful for benchmarking!)
- `org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine.cache` is the prefix for a set of loggers that output specific information about the caches. Although the names of the cache loggers are configurable by the user and thus could change, by default they are:
  - `org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine.cache.TEMPLATE_CACHE`
  - `org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine.cache.EXPRESSION_CACHE`

An example configuration for Thymeleaf’s logging infrastructure, using `log4j`, could be:
```properties
log4j.logger.org.thymeleaf=DEBUG
log4j.logger.org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine.CONFIG=TRACE
log4j.logger.org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine.TIMER=TRACE
log4j.logger.org.thymeleaf.TemplateEngine.cache.TEMPLATE_CACHE=TRACE
```
