### 5.6 设置任何属性的值（默认的属性处理器）

Thymeleaf offers a default attribute processor that allows us to set the value of any attribute, even if no specific th:* processor has been defined for it at the Standard Dialect.

So something like:
```html
<span th:whatever="${user.name}">...</span>
```
Will result in:
```html
<span whatever="John Apricot">...</span>
```
