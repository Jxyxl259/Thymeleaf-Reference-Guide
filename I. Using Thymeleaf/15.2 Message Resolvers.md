We did not explicitly specify a Message Resolver implementation for our Grocery application, and as it was explained before, this meant that the implementation being used was an `org.thymeleaf.messageresolver.StandardMessageResolver` object.

`StandardMessageResolver` is the standard implementation of the `IMessageResolver` interface, but we could create our own if we wanted, adapted to the specific needs of our application.

```
The Thymeleaf + Spring integration packages offer by default an `IMessageResolver` implementation which uses the standard Spring way of retrieving externalized messages, by using `MessageSource` beans declared at the Spring Application Context.
