### 4.13 无操作标记

The No-Operation token is represented by an underscore symbol (`_`).

The idea behind this token is to specify that the desired result for an expression is to do nothing, i.e. do exactly as if the processable attribute (e.g. `th:text`) was not there at all.

Among other possibilities, this allows developers to use prototyping text as default values. For example, instead of:
```html
<span th:text="${user.name} ?: 'no user authenticated'">...</span>
```
…we can directly use ‘no user authenticated’ as a prototyping text, which results in code that is both more concise and versatile from a design standpoint:
```html
<span th:text="${user.name} ?: _">no user authenticated</span>
```
