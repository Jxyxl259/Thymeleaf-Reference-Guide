### 12.1. 表达式内联

Although the Standard Dialect allows us to do almost everything using tag attributes, there are situations in which we could prefer writing expressions directly into our HTML texts. For example, we could prefer writing this:
```html
<p>Hello, [[${session.user.name}]]!</p>
```
…instead of this:
```html
<p>Hello, <span th:text="${session.user.name}">Sebastian</span>!</p>
```
Expressions between `[[...]]` or `[(...)]` are considered `inlined expressions` in Thymeleaf, and inside them we can use any kind of expression that would also be valid in a `th:text` or `th:utext` attribute.

Note that, while `[[...]]` corresponds to `th:text` (i.e. result will be HTML-escaped), `[(...)]` corresponds to `th:utext` and will not perform any HTML-escaping. So with a variable such as `msg = 'This is <b>great!</b>'`, given this fragment:
```html
<p>The message is "[(${msg})]"</p>
```
The result will have those `<b>` tags unescaped, so:
```html
<p>The message is "This is <b>great!</b>"</p>
```
Whereas if escaped like:
```html
<p>The message is "[[${msg}]]"</p>
```
The result will be HTML-escaped:
```html
<p>The message is "This is &lt;b&gt;great!&lt;/b&gt;"</p>
```
Note that `text inlining is active by default` in the body of every tag in our markup –- not the tags themselves -–, so there is nothing we need to do to enable it.
