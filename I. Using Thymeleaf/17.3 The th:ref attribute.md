`th:ref` is only a marker attribute. It does nothing from the processing standpoint and simply disappears when the template is processed, but its usefulness lies in the fact that it acts as a markup reference, i.e. it can be resolved by name from a markup selector just like a tag name or a fragment (`th:fragment`).

So if we have a selector like:
```html
  <attr sel="whatever" .../>
```
This will match:

- Any `<whatever>` tags.
- Any tags with a `th:fragment="whatever"` attribute.
- Any tags with a `th:ref="whatever"` attribute.

What is the advantage of `th:ref` against, for example, using a pure-HTML `id` attribute? Merely the fact that we might not want to add so many `id` and `class` attributes to our tags to act as logic anchors, which might end up polluting our output.

And in the same sense, what is the disadvantage of `th:ref`? Well, obviously that we’d be adding a bit of Thymeleaf logic (“logic”) to our templates.

Note this applicability of the `th:ref` attribute `does not only apply to decoupled logic template files`: it works the same in other types of scenarios, like in fragment expressions (`~{...}`).
