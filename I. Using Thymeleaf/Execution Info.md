### 执行信息

- **#execInfo**: 提供了在Thymeleaf标准表达式里面被处理的模版的相关信息。

```java
/*
 * ======================================================================
 * See javadoc API for class org.thymeleaf.expression.ExecutionInfo
 * ======================================================================
 */

/*
 * Return the name and mode of the 'leaf' template. This means the template
 * from where the events being processed were parsed. So if this piece of
 * code is not in the root template "A" but on a fragment being inserted
 * into "A" from another template called "B", this will return "B" as a
 * name, and B's mode as template mode.
 */
${#execInfo.templateName}
${#execInfo.templateMode}

/*
 * Return the name and mode of the 'root' template. This means the template
 * that the template engine was originally asked to process. So if this
 * piece of code is not in the root template "A" but on a fragment being
 * inserted into "A" from another template called "B", this will still 
 * return "A" and A's template mode.
 */
${#execInfo.processedTemplateName}
${#execInfo.processedTemplateMode}

/*
 * Return the stacks (actually, List<String> or List<TemplateMode>) of
 * templates being processed. The first element will be the 
 * 'processedTemplate' (the root one), the last one will be the 'leaf'
 * template, and in the middle all the fragments inserted in nested
 * manner to reach the leaf from the root will appear.
 */
${#execInfo.templateNames}
${#execInfo.templateModes}

/*
 * Return the stack of templates being processed similarly (and in the
 * same order) to 'templateNames' and 'templateModes', but returning
 * a List<TemplateData> with the full template metadata.
 */
${#execInfo.templateStack}
