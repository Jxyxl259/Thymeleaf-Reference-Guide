### 12.4 CSS内联

Thymeleaf also allows the use of inlining in CSS `<style>` tags, such as:
```html
<style th:inline="css">
  ...
</style>
```
For example, say we have two variables set to two different String values:
```html
classname = 'main elems'
align = 'center'
```
We could use them just like:
```html
<style th:inline="css">
    .[[${classname}]] {
      text-align: [[${align}]];
    }
</style>
```
And the result would be:
```html
<style th:inline="css">
    .main\ elems {
      text-align: center;
    }
</style>
```
Note how CSS inlining also bears some intelligence, just like JavaScript’s. Specifically, expressions output via escaped expressions like `[[${classname}]]` will be escaped as `CSS identifiers`. That is why our `classname = 'main elems'` has turned into `main\ elems` in the fragment of code above.
