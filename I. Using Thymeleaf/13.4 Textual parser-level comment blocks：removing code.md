### 13.4 文本解析器级别注释块：移除代码

In a way similar to that of prototype-only comment blocks, all the three textual template modes (`TEXT`, `JAVASCRIPT` and `CSS`) make it possible to instruct Thymeleaf to remove code between special `/*[- */` and `/* -]*/` marks, like this:
```javascript
var x = 23;

/*[- */

var msg  = "This is shown only when executed statically!";

/* -]*/

var f = function() {
...
```
Or this, in `TEXT` mode:
```
...
/*[- Note the user is obtained from the session, which must exist -]*/
Welcome [(${session.user.name})]!
...
```
