Fragment expressions are an easy way to represent fragments of markup and move them around templates. This allows us to replicate them, pass them to other templates as arguments, and so on.

The most common use is for fragment insertion using `th:insert` or `th:replace` (more on these in a later section):
```html
<div th:insert="~{commons :: main}">...</div>
```
But they can be used anywhere, just as any other variable:
```html
<div th:with="frag=~{footer :: #main/text()}">
  <p th:insert="${frag}">
</div>
Later in this tutorial there is an entire section devoted to Template Layout, including deeper explanation of fragment expressions.
