### 5.7 对HTML5友好的属性和元素名的支持

It is also possible to use a completely different syntax to apply processors to your templates in a more HTML5-friendly manner.
```html
<table>
    <tr data-th-each="user : ${users}">
        <td data-th-text="${user.login}">...</td>
        <td data-th-text="${user.name}">...</td>
    </tr>
</table>
```
The `data-{prefix}-{name}` syntax is the standard way to write custom attributes in HTML5, without requiring developers to use any namespaced names like `th:*`. Thymeleaf makes this syntax automatically available to all your dialects (not only the Standard ones).

There is also a syntax to specify custom tags: `{prefix}-{name}`, which follows the W3C Custom Elements specification (a part of the larger W3C Web Components spec). This can be used, for example, for the `th:block` element (or also `th-block`), which will be explained in a later section.

**Important**: this syntax is an addition to the namespaced `th:*` one, it does not replace it. There is no intention at all to deprecate the namespaced syntax in the future.
