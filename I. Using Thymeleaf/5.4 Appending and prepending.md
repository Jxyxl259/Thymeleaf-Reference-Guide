### 5.4 附加与前置

Thymeleaf also offers the `th:attrappend` and `th:attrprepend` attributes, which append (suffix) or prepend (prefix) the result of their evaluation to the existing attribute values.

For example, you might want to store the name of a CSS class to be added (not set, just added) to one of your buttons in a context variable, because the specific CSS class to be used would depend on something that the user did before:
```html
<input type="button" value="Do it!" class="btn" th:attrappend="class=${' ' + cssStyle}" />
```
If you process this template with the `cssStyle` variable set to `"warning"`, you will get:
```html
<input type="button" value="Do it!" class="btn warning" />
```
There are also two specific appending attributes in the Standard Dialect: the `th:classappend` and `th:styleappend` attributes, which are used for adding a CSS class or a fragment of style to an element without overwriting the existing ones:
```html
<tr th:each="prod : ${prods}" class="row" th:classappend="${prodStat.odd}? 'odd'">
```
(Don’t worry about that `th:each` attribute. It is an iterating attribute and we will talk about it later.)
