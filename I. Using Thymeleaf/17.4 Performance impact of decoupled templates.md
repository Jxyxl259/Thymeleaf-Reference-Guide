### 17.4 解耦的模板对性能的影响

The impact is extremely small. When a resolved template is marked to use decoupled logic and it is not cached, the template logic resource will be resolved first, parsed and processed into a secuence of instructions in-memory: basically a list of attributes to be injected to each markup selector.

But this is the only additional step required because, after this, the real template will be parsed, and while it is parsed these attributes will be injected on-the-fly by the parser itself, thanks to the advanced capabilities for node selection in AttoParser. So parsed nodes will come out of the parser as if they had their injected attributes written in the original template file.

The biggest advantage of this? When a template is configured to be cached, it will be cached already containing the injected attributes. So the overhead of using decoupled templates for cacheable templates, once they are cached, will be absolutely zero.
