### 12.2 文本内联

Text inlining is very similar to the expression inlining capability we have just seen, but it actually adds more power. It has to be enabled explicitly with `th:inline="text"`.

Text inlining not only allows us to use the same inlined expressions we just saw, but in fact processes tag bodies as if they were templates processed in the `TEXT` template mode, which allows us to perform text-based template logic (not only output expressions).

We will see more about this in the next chapter about the textual template modes.
