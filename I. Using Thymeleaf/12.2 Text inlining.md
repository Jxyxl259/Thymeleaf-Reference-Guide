### 12.2 文本内联

文本内联与表达式内联非常相似，但是实际上文本表达式更加强大。它需要使用`th:inline="text"`显式地启用。

Text inlining not only allows us to use the same inlined expressions we just saw, but in fact processes tag bodies as if they were templates processed in the `TEXT` template mode, which allows us to perform text-based template logic (not only output expressions).

We will see more about this in the next chapter about the textual template modes.
