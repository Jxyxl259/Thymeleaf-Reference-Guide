### 6.3 通过数据的懒惰检索实现优化

Sometimes we might want to optimize the retrieval of collections of data (e.g. from a database) so that these collections are only retrieved if they are really going to be used.
```
Actually, this is something that can be applied to any piece of data, but given the size that in-memory collections might have, retrieving collections that are meant to be iterated is the most common case for this scenario.
```
In order to support this, Thymeleaf offers a mechanism to lazily load context variables. Context variables that implement the `ILazyContextVariable` interface – most probably by extending its `LazyContextVariable` default implementation – will be resolved in the moment of being executed. For example:
```java
context.setVariable(
     "users",
     new LazyContextVariable<List<User>>() {
         @Override
         protected List<User> loadValue() {
             return databaseRepository.findAllUsers();
         }
     });
```
This variable can be used without knowledge of its lazyness, in code such as:
```html
<ul>
  <li th:each="u : ${users}" th:text="${u.name}">user name</li>
</ul>
```
But at the same time, will never be initialized (its `loadValue()` method will never be called) if `condition` evaluates to `false` in code such as:
```html
<ul th:if="${condition}">
  <li th:each="u : ${users}" th:text="${u.name}">user name</li>
</ul>
```
