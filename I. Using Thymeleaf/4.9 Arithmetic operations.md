### 4.9 算术运算

Some arithmetic operations are also available: `+`, `-`, `*`, `/` and `%`.
```html
<div th:with="isEven=(${prodStat.count} % 2 == 0)">
```
Note that these operators can also be applied inside OGNL variable expressions themselves (and in that case will be executed by OGNL instead of the Thymeleaf Standard Expression engine):
```html
<div th:with="isEven=${prodStat.count % 2 == 0}">
```
Note that textual aliases exist for some of these operators: `div` (`/`), `mod` (`%`).
