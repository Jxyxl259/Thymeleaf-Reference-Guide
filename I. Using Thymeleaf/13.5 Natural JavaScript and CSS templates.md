### 13.5 自然JavaScript和CSS模版

As seen in the previous chapter, JavaScript and CSS inlining offer the possibility to include inlined expressions inside JavaScript/CSS comments, like:
```javascript
...
var username = /*[[${session.user.name}]]*/ "Sebastian Lychee";
...
```
…which is valid JavaScript, and once executed could look like:
```javascript
...
var username = "John Apricot";
...
```
This same trick of enclosing inlined expressions inside comments can in fact be used for the entire textual mode syntax:
```javascript
  /*[# th:if="${user.admin}"]*/
     alert('Welcome admin');
  /*[/]*/
```
That alert in the code above will be shown when the template is open statically – because it is 100% valid JavaScript –, and also when the template is run if the user is an admin. It is equivalent to:
```javascript
  [# th:if="${user.admin}"]
     alert('Welcome admin');
  [/]
```
…which is actually the code to which the initial version is converted during template parsing.

Note however that wrapping elements in comments does not clean the lines they live in (to the right until a `;` is found) as inlined output expressions do. That behaviour is reserved for inlined output expressions only.

So Thymeleaf 3.0 allows the development of `complex JavaScript scripts and CSS style sheets in the form of natural templates`, valid both as a prototype and as a working template.
