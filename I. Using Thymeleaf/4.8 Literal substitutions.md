### 4.8 字面量置换

Literal substitutions allow for an easy formatting of strings containing values from variables without the need to append literals with `'...'` + `'...'`.

These substitutions must be surrounded by vertical bars (`|`), like:
```html
<span th:text="|Welcome to our application, ${user.name}!|">
```
Which is equivalent to:
```html
<span th:text="'Welcome to our application, ' + ${user.name} + '!'">
```
Literal substitutions can be combined with other types of expressions:
```html
<span th:text="${onevar} + ' ' + |${twovar}, ${threevar}|">
```
```
Only variable/message expressions (`${...}`, `*{...}`, `#{...}`) are allowed inside `|...|` literal substitutions. No other literals ('...'), boolean/numeric tokens, conditional expressions etc. are.
