### 4.11 条件表达式

Conditional expressions are meant to evaluate only one of two expressions depending on the result of evaluating a condition (which is itself another expression).

Let’s have a look at an example fragment (introducing another attribute modifier, `th:class`):
```html
<tr th:class="${row.even}? 'even' : 'odd'">
  ...
</tr>
```
All three parts of a conditional expression (`condition`, `then` and `else`) are themselves expressions, which means that they can be variables (`${...}`, `*{...}`), messages (`#{...}`), URLs (`@{...}`) or literals (`'...'`).

Conditional expressions can also be nested using parentheses:
```html
<tr th:class="${row.even}? (${row.first}? 'first' : 'even') : 'odd'">
  ...
</tr>
```
Else expressions can also be omitted, in which case a null value is returned if the condition is false:
```html
<tr th:class="${row.even}? 'alt'">
  ...
</tr>
```
