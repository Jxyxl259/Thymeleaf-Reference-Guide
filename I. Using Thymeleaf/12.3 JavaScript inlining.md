### 12.3 JavaScript内联

JavaScript内联考虑了更好地整合`HTML`模版模式下的JavaScript `<script>`块。

As with text inlining, this is actually equivalent to processing the scripts contents as if they were templates in the `JAVASCRIPT` template mode, and therefore all the power of the textual template modes (see next chapter) will be at hand. However, in this section we will focus on how we can use it for adding the output of our Thymeleaf expressions into our JavaScript blocks.

This mode has to be explicitly enabled using `th:inline="javascript"`:
```html
<script th:inline="javascript">
    ...
    var username = [[${session.user.name}]];
    ...
</script>
```
This will result in:
```html
<script th:inline="javascript">
    ...
    var username = "Sebastian \"Fruity\" Applejuice";
    ...
</script>
```
Two important things to note in the code above:

First, that JavaScript inlining will not only output the required text, but also enclose it with quotes and JavaScript-escape its contents, so that the expression results are output as a `well-formed JavaScript literal`.

Second, that this is happening because we are outputting the `${session.user.name}` expression as `escaped`, i.e. using a double-bracket expression: `[[${session.user.name}]]`. If instead we used unescaped like:
```html
<script th:inline="javascript">
    ...
    var username = [(${session.user.name})];
    ...
</script>
```
The result would look like:
```html
<script th:inline="javascript">
    ...
    var username = Sebastian "Fruity" Applejuice;
    ...
</script>
```
…which is malformed JavaScript code. But outputting something unescaped might be what we need if we are building parts of our script by means of appending inlined expressions, so it’s good to have this tool at hand.
