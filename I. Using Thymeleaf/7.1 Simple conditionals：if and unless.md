### 7.1 简单条件：if与unless

有时，你会需要模版的某部分在满足特定条件时，才在结果中显示。

For example, imagine we want to show in our product table a column with the number of comments that exist for each product and, if there are any comments, a link to the comment detail page for that product.

In order to do this, we would use the `th:if` attribute:
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>NAME</th>
    <th>PRICE</th>
    <th>IN STOCK</th>
    <th>COMMENTS</th>
  </tr>
  <tr th:each="prod : ${prods}" th:class="${prodStat.odd}? 'odd'">
    <td th:text="${prod.name}">Onions</td>
    <td th:text="${prod.price}">2.41</td>
    <td th:text="${prod.inStock}? #{true} : #{false}">yes</td>
    <td>
      <span th:text="${#lists.size(prod.comments)}">2</span> comment/s
      <a href="comments.html" 
         th:href="@{/product/comments(prodId=${prod.id})}" 
         th:if="${not #lists.isEmpty(prod.comments)}">view</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Quite a lot of things to see here, so let’s focus on the important line:
```html
<a href="comments.html"
   th:href="@{/product/comments(prodId=${prod.id})}" 
   th:if="${not #lists.isEmpty(prod.comments)}">view</a>
```
This will create a link to the comments page (with URL `/product/comments`) with a `prodId` parameter set to the `id` of the product, but only if the product has any comments.

Let’s have a look at the resulting markup:
```html
<table>
  <tr>
    <th>NAME</th>
    <th>PRICE</th>
    <th>IN STOCK</th>
    <th>COMMENTS</th>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Fresh Sweet Basil</td>
    <td>4.99</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>
      <span>0</span> comment/s
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>Italian Tomato</td>
    <td>1.25</td>
    <td>no</td>
    <td>
      <span>2</span> comment/s
      <a href="/gtvg/product/comments?prodId=2">view</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr>
    <td>Yellow Bell Pepper</td>
    <td>2.50</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>
      <span>0</span> comment/s
    </td>
  </tr>
  <tr class="odd">
    <td>Old Cheddar</td>
    <td>18.75</td>
    <td>yes</td>
    <td>
      <span>1</span> comment/s
      <a href="/gtvg/product/comments?prodId=4">view</a>
    </td>
  </tr>
</table>
```
Perfect! That’s exactly what we wanted.

Note that the `th:if` attribute will not only evaluate boolean conditions. Its capabilities go a little beyond that, and it will evaluate the specified expression as `true` following these rules:

- If value is not null:
	- If value is a boolean and is true.
	- If value is a number and is non-zero
	- If value is a character and is non-zero
	- If value is a String and is not “false”, “off” or “no”
	- If value is not a boolean, a number, a character or a String.
- (If value is null, th:if will evaluate to false).

Also, `th:if` has an inverse attribute, `th:unless`, which we could have used in the previous example instead of using a `not` inside the OGNL expression:
```html
<a href="comments.html"
   th:href="@{/comments(prodId=${prod.id})}" 
   th:unless="${#lists.isEmpty(prod.comments)}">view</a>
```
