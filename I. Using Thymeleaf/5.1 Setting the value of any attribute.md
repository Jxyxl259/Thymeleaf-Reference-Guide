### 5.1 设置任何属性的值

Say our website publishes a newsletter, and we want our users to be able to subscribe to it, so we create a /WEB-INF/templates/subscribe.html template with a form:

<form action="subscribe.html">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="text" name="email" />
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe!" />
  </fieldset>
</form>
As with Thymeleaf, this template starts off more like a static prototype than it does a template for a web application. First, the action attribute in our form statically links to the template file itself, so that there is no place for useful URL rewriting. Second, the value attribute in the submit button makes it display a text in English, but we’d like it to be internationalized.

Enter then the th:attr attribute, and its ability to change the value of attributes of the tags it is set in:

<form action="subscribe.html" th:attr="action=@{/subscribe}">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="text" name="email" />
    <input type="submit" value="Subscribe!" th:attr="value=#{subscribe.submit}"/>
  </fieldset>
</form>
The concept is quite straightforward: th:attr simply takes an expression that assigns a value to an attribute. Having created the corresponding controller and messages files, the result of processing this file will be:

<form action="/gtvg/subscribe">
  <fieldset>
    <input type="text" name="email" />
    <input type="submit" value="¡Suscríbe!"/>
  </fieldset>
</form>
Besides the new attribute values, you can also see that the applicacion context name has been automatically prefixed to the URL base in /gtvg/subscribe, as explained in the previous chapter.

But what if we wanted to set more than one attribute at a time? XML rules do not allow you to set an attribute twice in a tag, so th:attr will take a comma-separated list of assignments, like:

<img src="../../images/gtvglogo.png" 
     th:attr="src=@{/images/gtvglogo.png},title=#{logo},alt=#{logo}" />
Given the required messages files, this will output:

<img src="/gtgv/images/gtvglogo.png" title="Logo de Good Thymes" alt="Logo de Good Thymes" />
