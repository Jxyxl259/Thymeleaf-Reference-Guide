### 4.4 链接URL

在网络应用模版里，因为其重要性，URL也是一等公民。Thymeleaf标准方言为它们提供了`@`语法：`@{...}`

URL有不同的类型：

- 绝对URL: `http://www.thymeleaf.org`
- 相对URL，可以是：
  - 相对于网页： `user/login.html`
  - 相对于上下文： `/itemdetails?id=3` （服务器上上下文的名字会被自动添加）
  - 相对于服务器： `~/billing/processInvoice` （允许在另一个上下文里调用URL（= application），在同一个服务器上
  - Protocol-relative URLs: `//code.jquery.com/jquery-2.0.3.min.js`
The real processing of these expressions and their conversion to the URLs that will be output is done by implementations of the `org.thymeleaf.linkbuilder.ILinkBuilder` interface that are registered into the `ITemplateEngine` object being used.

By default, a single implementation of this interface is registered of the class `org.thymeleaf.linkbuilder.StandardLinkBuilder`, which is enough for both offline (non-web) and also web scenarios based on the Servlet API. Other scenarios (like integration with non-ServletAPI web frameworks) might need specific implementations of the link builder interface.

Let’s use this new syntax. Meet the `th:href` attribute:
```html
<!-- Will produce 'http://localhost:8080/gtvg/order/details?orderId=3' (plus rewriting) -->
<a href="details.html" 
   th:href="@{http://localhost:8080/gtvg/order/details(orderId=${o.id})}">view</a>

<!-- Will produce '/gtvg/order/details?orderId=3' (plus rewriting) -->
<a href="details.html" th:href="@{/order/details(orderId=${o.id})}">view</a>

<!-- Will produce '/gtvg/order/3/details' (plus rewriting) -->
<a href="details.html" th:href="@{/order/{orderId}/details(orderId=${o.id})}">view</a>
```
Some things to note here:

- `th:href` is a modifier attribute: once processed, it will compute the link URL to be used and set that value to the `href` attribute of the `<a>` tag.
- We are allowed to use expressions for URL parameters (as you can see in `orderId=${o.id}`). The required URL-parameter-encoding operations will also be automatically performed.
- If several parameters are needed, these will be separated by commas: `@{/order/process(execId=${execId},execType='FAST')}`
- Variable templates are also allowed in URL paths: @{/order/{orderId}/details(orderId=${orderId})}
- Relative URLs starting with `/` (eg: `/order/details`) will be automatically prefixed by the application context name.
- If cookies are not enabled or this is not yet known, a `";jsessionid=..."` suffix might be added to relative URLs so that the session is preserved. This is called URL Rewriting and Thymeleaf allows you to plug in your own rewriting filters by using the `response.encodeURL(...)` mechanism from the Servlet API for every URL.
- The `th:href` attribute allows us to (optionally) have a working static `href` attribute in our template, so that our template links remained navigable by a browser when opened directly for prototyping purposes.

As was the case with the message syntax (`#{...}`), URL bases can also be the result of evaluating another expression:
```html
<a th:href="@{${url}(orderId=${o.id})}">view</a>
<a th:href="@{'/details/'+${user.login}(orderId=${o.id})}">view</a>
```
