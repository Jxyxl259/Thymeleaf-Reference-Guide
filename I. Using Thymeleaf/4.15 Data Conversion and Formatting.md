### 4.15 数据转换/格式化

Thymeleaf defines a double-brace syntax for variable (`${...}`) and selection (`*{...}`) expressions that allows us to apply data conversion by means of a configured conversion service.

It basically goes like this:
```html
<td th:text="${{user.lastAccessDate}}">...</td>
```
Noticed the double brace there?: `${{...}}`. That instructs Thymeleaf to pass the result of the `user.lastAccessDate` expression to the conversion service and asks it to perform a **formatting operation** (a conversion to `String`) before writing the result.

Assuming that `user.lastAccessDate` is of type `java.util.Calendar`, if a conversion service (implementation of `IStandardConversionService`) has been registered and contains a valid conversion for `Calendar -> String`, it will be applied.

The default implementation of `IStandardConversionService` (the `StandardConversionService` class) simply executes `.toString()` on any object converted to `String`. For more information on how to register a custom conversion service implementation, have a look at the [More on Configuration](http://www.thymeleaf.org/doc/tutorials/3.0/usingthymeleaf.html#more-on-configuration) section.
```
The official thymeleaf-spring3 and thymeleaf-spring4 integration packages transparently integrate Thymeleaf’s conversion service mechanism with Spring’s own Conversion Service infrastructure, so that conversion services and formatters declared in the Spring configuration will be made automatically available to `${{...}}` and `*{{...}}` expressions.
