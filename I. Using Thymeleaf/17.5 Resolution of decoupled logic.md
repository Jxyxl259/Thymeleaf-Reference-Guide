### 17.5 解耦的逻辑的解析

The way Thymeleaf resolves the decoupled logic resources corresponding to each template is configurable by the user. It is determined by an extension point, the `org.thymeleaf.templateparser.markup.decoupled.IDecoupledTemplateLogicResolver`, for which a default implementation is provided: `StandardDecoupledTemplateLogicResolver`.

What does this standard implementation do?

- First, it applies a `prefix` and a `suffix` to the base name of the template resource (obtained by means of its `ITemplateResource#getBaseName()` method). Both prefix and suffix can be configured and, by default, the prefix will be empty and the suffix will be `.th.xml`.
- Second, it asks the template resource to resolve a relative resource with the computed name by means of its `ITemplateResource#relative(String relativeLocation)` method.
The specific implementation of `IDecoupledTemplateLogicResolver` to be used can be configured at the `TemplateEngine` easily:
```java
final StandardDecoupledTemplateLogicResolver decoupledresolver = 
        new StandardDecoupledTemplateLogicResolver();
decoupledResolver.setPrefix("../viewlogic/");
...
templateEngine.setDecoupledTemplateLogicResolver(decoupledResolver);
```
