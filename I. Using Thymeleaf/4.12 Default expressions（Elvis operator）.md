### 4.12 默认表达式（猫王运算符）

A default expression is a special kind of conditional value without a then part. It is equivalent to the Elvis operator present in some languages like Groovy, lets you specify two expressions: the first one is used if it doesn’t evaluate to null, but if it does then the second one is used.

Let’s see it in action in our user profile page:
```html
<div th:object="${session.user}">
  ...
  <p>Age: <span th:text="*{age}?: '(no age specified)'">27</span>.</p>
</div>
```
As you can see, the operator is `?:`, and we use it here to specify a default value for a name (a literal value, in this case) only if the result of evaluating `*{age}` is null. This is therefore equivalent to:
```html
<p>Age: <span th:text="*{age != null}? *{age} : '(no age specified)'">27</span>.</p>
```
As with conditional values, they can contain nested expressions between parentheses:
```html
<p>
  Name: 
  <span th:text="*{firstName}?: (*{admin}? 'Admin' : #{default.username})">Sebastian</span>
</p>
```
