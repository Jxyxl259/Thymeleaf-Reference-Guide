### 4.14 预处理

In addition to all these features for expression processing, Thymeleaf has the feature of preprocessing expressions.

Preprocessing is an execution of the expressions done before the normal one that allows for modification of the expression that will eventually be executed.

Preprocessed expressions are exactly like normal ones, but appear surrounded by a double underscore symbol (like `__${expression}__`).

Let’s imagine we have an i18n `Messages_fr.properties` entry containing an OGNL expression calling a language-specific static method, like:
```properties
article.text=@myapp.translator.Translator@translateToFrench({0})
```
…and a `Messages_es.properties equivalent`:
```properties
article.text=@myapp.translator.Translator@translateToSpanish({0})
```
We can create a fragment of markup that evaluates one expression or the other depending on the locale. For this, we will first select the expression (by preprocessing) and then let Thymeleaf execute it:
```html
<p th:text="${__#{article.text('textVar')}__}">Some text here...</p>
```
Note that the preprocessing step for a French locale will be creating the following equivalent:
```html
<p th:text="${@myapp.translator.Translator@translateToFrench(textVar)}">Some text here...</p>
```
The preprocessing String `__` can be escaped in attributes using `\_\_`.
