### 15.1 模板解析器

For our Good Thymes Virtual Grocery, we chose an `ITemplateResolver` implementation called `ServletContextTemplateResolver` that allowed us to obtain templates as resources from the Servlet Context.

Besides giving us the ability to create our own template resolver by implementing `ITemplateResolver`, Thymeleaf includes four implementations out of the box:

- `org.thymeleaf.templateresolver.ClassLoaderTemplateResolver`, which resolves templates as classloader resources, like:
```java
return Thread.currentThread().getContextClassLoader().getResourceAsStream(template);
```
- `org.thymeleaf.templateresolver.FileTemplateResolver`, which resolves templates as files from the file system, like:
```java
return new FileInputStream(new File(template));
```
- `org.thymeleaf.templateresolver.UrlTemplateResolver`, which resolves templates as URLs (even non-local ones), like:
```java
return (new URL(template)).openStream();
```
- `org.thymeleaf.templateresolver.StringTemplateResolver`, which resolves templates directly as the `String` being specified as `template` (or template name, which in this case is obviously much more than a mere name):
```java
return new StringReader(templateName);
```
All of the pre-bundled implementations of `ITemplateResolver` allow the same set of configuration parameters, which include:

- Prefix and suffix (as already seen):
```java
templateResolver.setPrefix("/WEB-INF/templates/");
templateResolver.setSuffix(".html");
```
- Template aliases that allow the use of template names that do not directly correspond to file names. If both suffix/prefix and alias exist, alias will be applied before prefix/suffix:
```java
templateResolver.addTemplateAlias("adminHome","profiles/admin/home");
templateResolver.setTemplateAliases(aliasesMap);
```
- Encoding to be applied when reading templates:
```java
templateResolver.setEncoding("UTF-8");
```
- Template mode to be used:
```java
// Default is HTML
templateResolver.setTemplateMode("XML");
```
- Default mode for template cache, and patterns for defining whether specific templates are cacheable or not:
```java
// Default is true
templateResolver.setCacheable(false);
templateResolver.getCacheablePatternSpec().addPattern("/users/*");
```
- TTL in milliseconds for parsed template cache entries originated in this template resolver. If not set, the only way to remove an entry from the cache will be to exceed the cache max size (oldest entry will be removed).
```java
// Default is no TTL (only cache size exceeded would remove entries)
templateResolver.setCacheTTLMs(60000L);
```
```
The Thymeleaf + Spring integration packages offer a `SpringResourceTemplateResolver` implementation which uses all the Spring infrastructure for accessing and reading resources in applications, and which is the recommended implementation in Spring-enabled applications.
