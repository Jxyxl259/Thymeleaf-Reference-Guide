### 15.3 转换服务

The conversion service that enables us to perform data conversion and formatting operations by means of the double-brace syntax (`${{...}}`) is actually a feature of the Standard Dialect, not of the Thymeleaf Template Engine itself.

As such, the way to configure it is by setting our custom implementation of the `IStandardConversionService` interface directly into the instance of `StandardDialect` that is being configured into the template engine. Like:
```java
IStandardConversionService customConversionService = ...

StandardDialect dialect = new StandardDialect();
dialect.setConversionService(customConversionService);

templateEngine.setDialect(dialect);
```
**注** Note that the thymeleaf-spring3 and thymeleaf-spring4 packages contain the `SpringStandardDialect`, and this dialect already comes pre-configured with an implementation of `IStandardConversionService` that integrates Spring’s own Conversion Service infrastructure into Thymeleaf.
