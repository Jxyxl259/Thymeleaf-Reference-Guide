### 4.10 比较和相等

Values in expressions can be compared with the `>`, `<`, `>=` and `<=` symbols, and the `==` and `!=` operators can be used to check for equality (or the lack of it). Note that XML establishes that the `<` and `>` symbols should not be used in attribute values, and so they should be substituted by `&lt;` and `&gt;`.
```html
<div th:if="${prodStat.count} &gt; 1">
<span th:text="'Execution mode is ' + ( (${execMode} == 'dev')? 'Development' : 'Production')">
```
A simpler alternative may be using textual aliases that exist for some of these operators: `gt` (`>`), `lt` (`<`), `ge` (`>=`), `le` (`<=`), `not` (`!`). Also `eq` (`==`), `neq`/`ne` (`!=`).
